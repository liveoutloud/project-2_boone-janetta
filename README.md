#### Resources
- My go-to reference was [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/).
- I referenced [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) for Grid help and also for how to size SVGs.
- I referenced [Flexbox Help](https://flexbox.help/) for information regarding Flexbox placement.
- Class recordings from Caitlyn and Richard.
- I also referered to our class textbook for a refresher on document.ready functions.

##### Custom jQuery
- My custom jQuery is found in my main.js file for submit and reset form validation buttons.
- A second piece of custom jQuery adds a border to the h4's by altering the CSS within main.js.

##### Custom javaScript
- My custom javaScript is found in my modal.js file. It targets elements by class and by ID in order to carry-out modal functioning.
- A second piece of custom javaScript code is an event listener which calls an h3 by ID and adds a box to it to highlight the CTA on mouseover.

##### Plugin 1
- [Smoothscroll](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/) was incorporated as my first jQuery plug-in for ease in navigating my single-scroll site.
##### Plugin 2
- [Tooltipster](http://iamceege.github.io/tooltipster/) was incorporated as my second jQuery plug-in to let new customers know about a 10% discount code.
#### Deductions
